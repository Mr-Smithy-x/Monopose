# Monopose
Monopose was developed in a 17 hour hackathon held by HackNY (April 2017). Our product won third place.
The application was built using the Clarifai API and using ZXing for Image recognition and scanning capabilities.
We used these api’s in order to help new gym “bodies” learn how to use the equipment properly by scanning the stance of the said poser. 
It also came with an instructional video that would show how there posture should be.
